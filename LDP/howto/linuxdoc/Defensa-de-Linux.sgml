<sect>About this document 
<p>

This is the Linux Advocacy mini-HOWTO and is intended to provide guidelines
and ideas to assist with <em>your</em> Linux advocacy efforts.

This mini-HOWTO was inspired by Jon ``maddog'' Hall when he responded to a
request for feedback on guidelines for advocating Linux during
<url url  = "http://www.netday.org"
     name = "NetDay"> activities.  He responded positively to the
guidelines and observed that they were the basis of a list of ``canons
of conduct'' that would benefit the Linux community.

A personal note: Due to various circumstances, I have not been able
to dedicate as much time to maintaining this mini-HOWTO and interacting
with the Linux community as I would have desired.  I apologize for this
and if you have attempted to contact me and I was slow in responding,
please forgive me being so inconsiderate.  While I still have many other
commitments, I am anticipating that they will start requiring less time
to meet and allow me to catch up on other parts of my life.
I appreciate your patience and would like to extend a special thanks
to all who have taken the time to suggest additions and corrections.

<sect>Introduction
<p>

The Linux community has known for some time that for many
applications, Linux is a stable, reliable, robust (although not
perfect) product.  Unfortunately, there are still many people,
including key decision-makers, that are not aware of the existence of
Linux and its capabilities.

If Linux and the many other components that make up a Linux
distribution are to reach their full potential, it is critical that we
reach out to prospective ``customers'' and advocate (being careful not
to promise too much) the use of Linux for appropriate applications.
The reason that many a company's products have done well in the
marketplace is not so much due to the product's technical superiority
but the company's marketing abilities.

If you enjoy using Linux and would like to contribute something to
the Linux community, please consider acting on one or more of the
ideas in this mini-HOWTO and help others learn more about Linux.

<sect>Advocating Linux
<p>

<itemize>
<item>Share your personal experiences (good and bad) with Linux.
      Everyone knows that software has bugs and limitations and
      if we only have glowing comments about Linux, we aren't
      being honest.  I <em>love</em> to tell people about having to
      reboot four times (three scheduled) in three years.

<item>If someone has a problem that Linux may be able to solve,
      offer to provide pointers to appropriate information
      (Web pages, magazine articles, books, consultants, &hellip;).
      If you haven't actually used the proposed solution, say so.

<item>If you are available for making presentations about Linux,
      register with the
      <url url  = "http://noframes.linuxjournal.com/lsb/listing.html"
           name = "Linux Speakers Bureau">.

<item>Offer to help someone start using Linux.  Follow up to make
      sure that they are able to use their system effectively.

<item>Some people still believe that Linux and similar systems
      operate only in text-mode.  Make sure that they are aware of
      the availability of graphical applications, such as the
      <url url  = "http://www.gimp.org/"
           name = "Gimp">.

<item>Try to respond to one ``newbie'' posting each week.
      Seek out the tough questions, you may be the only one
      to respond and you may learn something in the process.     
      However, if you aren't confident that you can respond with 
      the correct answer, find someone that can.

<item>Seek out small software development firms and offer to make
      a presentation about Linux.

<item>If the opportunity arises, make a presentation to your
      employer's Information Technology group.

<item>Participate in community events such as 
      <url url  = "http://www.netday.org/"
           name = "NetDay">.
      While your first priority must be to
      contribute to the success of the event, use the opportunity to let
      others know what Linux can do for them.

<item>Always consider the viewpoints of the person to whom you are
      ``selling'' Linux.  Support, reliability, interoperability and
      cost are all factors that a decision-maker must consider.
      Of the above, cost is often the least important portion of the equation.

<item>Availability of support is often mentioned as a concern when
      considering the adoption of Linux.  Companies such as
      <url url  = "http://www.caldera.com/"
           name = "Caldera">,
      <url url  = "http://www.cygnus.com/"
           name = "Cygnus Solutions">,
      <url url  = "http://www.redhat.com/"
           name = "Red Hat">,
      and
      <url url  = "http://www.suse.com/"
           name = "S.u.S.E.">
      offer support for some or all components of a typical Linux
      distribution.  In addition, the
      <url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Consultants-HOWTO.html"
           name = "Linux Consultants HOWTO">
      provides a listing of companies providing commercial
      Linux related support.  Of course, some of the best support is
      found in the <em>comp.os.linux</em> and <em>linux</em> newsgroup
      hierarchies.
      
<item>Point out that the production of
      <url url  = "http://www.opensource.org/"
           name = "open-source software">
      takes place in an environment of open collaboration between
      system architects, programmers, writers, alpha/beta testers
      and end users which often results in well documented, robust
      products such as
      <url url  = "http://www.apache.org/"
           name = "Apache">,
      <url url  = "http://www.gnu.org/"
           name = "GNU Emacs">,
      <url url  = "http://www.perl.com/"
           name = "Perl">
      and the 
      <url url  = "http://www.linuxhq.com/"
           name = "Linux kernel">.

<item>Stand up and be counted! Register with the
      <url url  = "http://counter.li.org/"
           name = "Linux Counter">.
 
<item>Report successful efforts of promoting Linux to
      <htmlurl url  = "http://www.li.org/"
               name = "Linux International">
      (<htmlurl url = "mailto:li@li.org"
               name = "li@li.org">)
      and similar organizations.

<item>Find a new home for Linux CD-ROMs and books that you no longer
      need.  Give them to someone interested in Linux, a public
      library or a school computer club.  A book and its CD-ROM
      would be most appropriate for a library.  However, please be
      sure that making the CD-ROM publicly available does not
      violate a licensing agreement or copyright.  Also, inform
      the library staff that the material on the CD-ROM is freely
      distributable.  Follow up to make sure it is available on
      the shelves.

<item>When purchasing books about software distributed with Linux,
      give preference to books written by the author of the software.
      The royalties that authors receive from book sales may be
      the only monetary compensation received for their efforts.

<item>Encourage Linux-based sites to submit their entry for the
      <url url  = "http://sunsite.nus.edu.sg/pub/LDP/powered.html"
           name = "Powered by Linux">
      page and suggest that banners promoting
      <url url  = "http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~conradp/banners/"
           name = "Linux">,
      <url url  = "http://www.apache.org/"
           name = "Apache">,
      <url url  = "http://www.gnu.org/"
           name = "GNU">,
      <url url  = "http://www.perl.com/"
           name = "Perl">
      &hellip; be displayed on their site.  

<item>Participate! If you have benefited from
      <url url  = "http://www.opensource.org/"
           name = "open-source software">,
      please consider assisting the free software community by:
      <itemize>
      <item>submitting detailed bug reports
      <item>writing documentation
      <item>creating artwork
      <item>supplying management skills
      <item>suggesting enhancements
      <item>providing technical support
      <item>contributing software
      <item>donating equipment
      <item>furnishing financial support.
       </itemize>
      The
      <url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
           name = "Linux Documentation Project">
      provides a
      <url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/devel.html"
           name = "list">
      of Linux and Linux-related projects.

<item>Finally, keep in mind that we all have infinitely more important
      issues to deal with than the selection of a computing environment.
</itemize>

<sect>Canons of Conduct
<p>

<itemize>
<item>As a representative of the Linux community, participate
      in mailing list and newsgroup discussions in a professional
      manner. Refrain from name-calling and use of vulgar language.
      Consider yourself a member of a virtual corporation
      with Mr. Torvalds as your Chief Executive Officer.  Your words
      will either enhance or degrade the image the reader has of the
      Linux community.

<item>Avoid hyperbole and unsubstantiated claims at all costs. It's
      unprofessional and will result in unproductive discussions.

<item>A thoughtful, well-reasoned response to a posting will not
      only provide insight for your readers, but will also increase
      their respect for your knowledge and abilities.
     
<item>Don't bite if offered flame-bait.  Too many threads degenerate
      into a ``My O/S is better than your O/S'' argument.
      Let's accurately describe the capabilities of Linux and
      leave it at that.

<item>Always remember that if you insult or are disrespectful
      to someone, their negative experience may be shared with many others.
      If you do offend someone, please try to make amends.

<item>Focus on what Linux has to offer.  There is no need to bash
      the competition.  Linux is a good, solid product
      that stands on its own.

<item>Respect the use of other operating systems.  While Linux is
      a wonderful platform, it does not meet everyone's needs.

<item>Refer to another product by its proper name.
      There's nothing to be gained by attempting to ridicule a company
      or its products by using ``creative spelling''.
      If we expect respect for Linux,  we must respect other products.

<item>Give credit where credit is due.  Linux is just the kernel.
      Without the efforts of people involved with the
      <url url  = "http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"
           name = "GNU project">,
      MIT, Berkeley and others too numerous to mention, the Linux
      kernel would not be very useful to most people.

<item>Don't insist that Linux is the only answer for a particular
      application. Just as the Linux community cherishes the freedom
      that Linux provides them, Linux only solutions would deprive 
      others of their freedom.

<item>There will be cases where Linux is not the
      answer.  Be the first to recognize this and offer another
      solution.
</itemize>


<sect>User Groups
<p>

<itemize>
<item>Participate in a local user group.  An
<url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/links/&num;lug"
     name = "index">
of Linux User Group registries is part of the
<url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/"
     name = "Linux Documentation Project">.
If a user group does not exist in your area, start one.

<item>The
      <url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/User-Group-HOWTO.html"
           name = "Linux User Group HOWTO">
      covers many of the issues involved with starting an
      user group and discusses the importance of Linux
      advocacy as one of the goals of a user group.

<item>Make speakers available to organizations interested in Linux.

<item>Issue
      <url url  = "http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~conradp/linux/pr/"
           name = "press releases">
      about your activities to your local media.

<item>Volunteer to configure a Linux system to meet the needs of
      local community organizations.  Of course, the installation
      process must include training the user community to use the
      system and adequate documentation for ongoing maintenance.

<item>Discus the Linux Advocacy mini-HOWTO at a meeting.  Brainstorm
      and submit new ideas. 
</itemize>


<sect>Vendor Relations
<p>

<itemize>
<item>When contemplating a hardware purchase, ask the vendor about 
      Linux support and other user's experiences with the product
      in a Linux environment. 

<item>Consider supporting vendors that sell Linux based products and
      services.  Encourage them to have their product listed in the
      <url url  = "http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Commercial-HOWTO.html"
           name = "Linux Commercial HOWTO">.

<item>Support vendors that donate a portion of their income to
      organizations such as the
      <url url  = "http://www.gnu.org/help/help.html"
           name = "Free Software Foundation">,
      the
      <url url  = "http://li.org/li/fund/grants.shtml"
           name = "Linux Development Grant Fund">,
      the
      <url url  = "http://www.xfree86.org/donations.html"
           name = "XFree86 Project">
      or
      <url url  = "http://www.debian.org/donations.html"
           name = "Software in the Public Interest">.
      If possible, make a personal donation to these or
      other organizations that support
      <url url  = "http://www.opensource.org/"
           name = "open-source software">.
      Don't forget that some employers offer a matching
      gift program program.

<item>If you need an application that is not supported on
      Linux, contact the vendor and request a native Linux version.

	 Introduction
      </title>

      <para> 
	 The purpose of this document is to introduce the novice VIM
	 user to the editing options available in VIM for C files. The
	 document introduces some commands and keystrokes which will
	 help in improving the productivity of programmers using VIM
	 to edit C files.
      </para>

      <para> 
	 The scope of the document is to describe how one can edit C
	 files with VIM. However most of what is described is also
	 applicable for vi. Plus what is mentioned here about editing
	 C files is more or less applicable to C++, Java and other similar
	 languages.

	 <para> 
	    One can use the <keycap>w</keycap>, <keycap>e</keycap> and 
	    <keycap>b</keycap> keys to move around a file. VIM is
	    capable of recognizing the different tokens within a C expression.

	 <para> 
	    Assume that the cursor is positioned at the beginning of
	    the <keycap>if</keycap> statement. By pressing w once the
	    cursor jumps to the first <keycap>(</keycap>. By typing
	    <keycap>w</keycap> again the cursor moves to
	    <keycap>NULL</keycap>. Next time the cursor will move to the
	    <keycap>==</keycap> token. Further keystrokes will take
	    you as follows. <keycap>x.</keycap>..
	    <keycap>)</keycap>... <keycap>&amp;&amp;</keycap>...
	    <keycap>y</keycap>... <keycap>&gt;</keycap>...
	    <keycap>z</keycap>...  and finally <keycap>)</keycap>...
	 </para>

	 <para> 
	    <keycap>e</keycap> is similar to <keycap>w</keycap> only
	    that it takes you to the end of the current word and not
	    to the beginning of the next word.
	 </para>

	 <para> 
	    <keycap>b</keycap> does the exact opposite of
	    <keycap>w</keycap>. It moves the cursor in the opposite
	    direction. So you can moving backwards using the
	    <keycap>b</keycap> keystroke.

	    {, }, [[ and ]] keystrokes

	 <para>
	    The <keycap>{</keycap> and <keycap>}</keycap> keys are
	    used to move from paragraph to paragraph. When editing C
	    files these keys have a slightly different meaning. Here a 
	    paragraph is taken as a bunch of lines separated by an
	    empty line.

	    The <keycap>{</keycap> and <keycap>}</keycap> keys are

	 <para> 
	    Another set of keys which are useful are the
	    <keycap>[[</keycap> and <keycap>]]</keycap> keys. These
	    keys allow you to jump to the previous { or next { in the

	 <para>
	    Lets say you were editing foo() and now you want to edit
	    bar(). Just type <keycap>]]</keycap> and the cursor will
	    take you to the opening { of the bar() function. The
	    reverse is slightly different. If you were in the middle of bar()
	    and you type <keycap>[[</keycap> the cursor will move to
	    the first { above i.e. the beginning of bar() itself. One
	    has to type <keycap>[[</keycap> again to move to the
	    beginning of foo(). The number of keystrokes can be
	    minimized by typing <keycap>2[[</keycap> to take the
	    cursor to the beginning of the previous function.
	 </para>

	 <para> 
	    Another set of similar keystrokes are the <keycap>][</keycap> and
	    <keycap>[]</keycap> keystrokes. <keycap>][</keycap> takes
	    the cursor to next } in the first column. If you were
	    editing foo() and wanted to go to the end of foo() then
	    <keycap>][</keycap> will take you there. Similarly if you were
	    editing bar() and wanted to go to the end of foo() then
	    <keycap>[]</keycap> would take the cursor there.
	 </para>

	 <para> 
	    The way to remember the keystrokes is by breaking them
	    up. The first keystroke will indicated whether to move up
	    or down. <keycap>[</keycap> will move up and
	    <keycap>]</keycap> will move down. The next keystroke
	    indicates the type of brace to match. If it same same as
	    the previous keystroke then the cursor will move to {. If
	    the keystroke is different then the cursor will move to
	    }. 
	 </para>

	 <para> 
	    One caveat of the <keycap>]]</keycap>, <keycap>][</keycap>,
	    <keycap>[[</keycap> and <keycap>[]</keycap> keystrokes is
	    that they match the braces which are in the
	    <Emphasis>first column</Emphasis>. If one wants to match
	    all braces upwards and downwards regardless of whether its
	    in the first column or not is not possible. The VIM
	    documentation has a workaround. One has to map the
	    keystrokes to find the braces. Without spending too much
	    time on mapping, the suggested mappings are

	 <title>
	    % keystroke
	 </title> 

	 <para> 
	    The <keycap>%</keycap> is used to match the item under the
	    cursor. The item under the cursor can be a parenthesis, a
	    curly bracket or a square bracket. By pressing the % key
	    the cursor will jump to the corresponding match.
	 </para>

	 <para> Amongst other things, the <keycap>%</keycap> keystroke
	    can be used to match #if, #ifdef, #else #elif and #endif
	    also.
	 </para> 

	 <para> 
	    This keystroke is very useful in validating code that one
	    has written. For Example

	 <para> 
	    Checking the above code will involve checking the correctness 
	    of the parenthesis. The <keycap>%</keycap> can be used to
	    jump from one ( to its corresponding ) and vice versa.
	    Thus, one can find which opening parenthesis corresponds to 
	    which closing parenthesis and use the information to
	    validate the code.  
	 </para>

	 <para> 
	    Similarly the <keycap>%</keycap> can also be used to jump
	    from a { to its corresponding }.

	    ctags
	 </title>

	 <para> 
	    A Tag is a sort of placeholder. Tags are very useful in
	    understanding and editing C. Tags are a set of
	    book-marks to each function in a C file. Tags are very
	    useful in jumping to the definition of a function from
	    where it is called and then jumping back.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    Take the following example.
	 </para>

		     foo()
		     {
		             ...
		             bar();
		             ...
		     }
		  
		     bar()
		     {
		             ...
		     }
		     ...
		  </programlisting>

	       </textobject>

	    </mediaobject>

	 </figure>

	 <para>
	    Lets say that you are editing the function foo() and you
	    come across the function bar(). Now, to see what bar()
	    does, one makes uses of Tags. One can jump to the
	    definition of bar() and then jump back later. If need be,
	    one can jump to another function called within bar() and back.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    To use Tags one must first run the program ctags on all
	    the source files. This creates a file called tags. This
	    file contains pointers to all the function definitions and
	    is used by VIM to take you to the function definition. 
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    The actual keystrokes for jumping to and fro are
	    <keycap>CTRL-]</keycap> and <keycap>CTRL-T</keycap>. By
	    hitting <keycap>CTRL-]</keycap> in foo() at the place
	    where bar() is called, takes the cursor to the beginning of
	    bar(). One can jump back from bar() to foo() by just
	    hitting <keycap>CTRL-T</keycap>. 
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    ctags are called by

	 </para>

	 <screen>
	    <prompt>$ </prompt><command>ctags *.c</command>
	 </screen>
	 
	 <para>
	    In case of a source tree which contains C files in
	    different sub directories, one can call ctags in the root
	    directory of the source tree with the -R option and a tags
	    file containing Tags to all functions in the source tree
	    will be created. For Example.
	 </para>

	 <screen>
	    <prompt>$ </prompt><command>ctags -R *.c</command>
	 </screen>

	 <para>
	    There are many other options to use with ctags. These
	    options are explained in the man file for ctags.

	 <title>
	    marks
	 </title> 

	 <para> 
	    Marks are place-holders like Tags. However, marks can be
	    set at any point in a file and is not limited to only
	    functions, enums etc.. Plus marks have be set manually by
	    the user.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    By setting a mark there is no visible indication of the
	    same. A mark is just a position in a file which is
	    remembered by VIM. Consider the following code

		             int x,y;
		             x=0;
		             y=1;
		             x++;
		             y++;
		             if( x != y )
		                     x = y;
		             y = x;
		     }
		  </programlisting>

	       </textobject>

	    </mediaobject>

	 </figure>




	 <para>
	    Suppose you are editing the line x++; and you want to come
	    back to that line after editing some other line. You can
	    set a mark on that line with the keystroke
	    <keycap>m'</keycap> and come back to the same line later
	    by hitting <keycap>''</keycap>.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    VIM allows you to set more than one mark. These marks are
	    stored in registers a-z, A-Z and 1-0. To set a mark and
	    store the same in a register say j, all one has to hit is
	    <keycap>mj</keycap>. To go back to the mark one has to hit
	    <keycap>'j</keycap>.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    Multiple marks are really useful in going back and fro
	    within a piece of code. Taking the same example, one might
	    want one mark at x++; and another at y=x; and jump between
	    them or to any other place and then jump back.
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    Marks can span across files. To use such marks one has to
	    use upper-case registers i.e. A-Z. Lower-case registers are
	    used only within files and do not span files. That's to
	    say, if you were to set a mark in a file foo.c in register
	    "a" and then move to another file and hit
	    <keycap>'a</keycap>, 
	    the cursor will not jump back to the previous
	    location. If you want a mark which will take you to a
	    different file then you will need to use an upper-case
	    register. For example, use <keycap>mA</keycap> instead of
	    <keycap>ma</keycap>. I'll talk about editing multiple
	    files in a later section.

	 <para>
	    For some reason you've forgotten what y and z are and want
	    to go to their declaration double quick. One way of doing
	    this is by searching backwards for  y or z. VIM offers a
	    simpler and quicker solution. The <keycap>gd</keycap>
	    keystroke stands for Goto Declaration. With the cursor on
	    "y" if you hit <keycap>gd</keycap> the cursor will take
	    you to the declaration :- struct Y y;. 
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    A similar keystroke is <keycap>gD</keycap>. This takes you
	    to the global declaration of the variable under the
	    cursor. So if one want to go to the declaration of x, then
	    all one needs to do is hit <keycap>gD</keycap> and the
	    cursor will move to the declaration of x.

	 </mediaobject>

      </figure>

      <para>
	 The function A_Very_Long_Function_Name() can be quite
	 exasperating to type over and over again. While still in
	 insert-mode, one can auto-complete a word by either searching
	 forwards or backwards. In function, Another_Function() one can 
	 type A_Very... and hit <keycap>CTRL-P</keycap>. The first
	 matching word will be displayed first. In this case it would
	 be A_Very_Long_Variable_Name. To complete it correctly, one can
	 hit <keycap>CTRL-P</keycap> again and the search continues
	 upwards to the next matching word, which is
	 A_Very_Long_Function_Name. As soon as the correct word is matched
	 you can continue typing. VIM remains in insert-mode during
	 the entire process. 
      </para>

      <para>
	 Similar to <keycap>CTRL-P</keycap> is the keystroke
	 <keycap>CTRL-N</keycap>. This searches forwards instead of
	 backwards. Both the keystrokes continue to search until they
	 hit the top or bottom. 
      </para>

      <para>
	 Both <keycap>CTRL-P</keycap> and <keycap>CTRL-N</keycap> are
	 part of a mode known as CTRL-X mode. CTRL-X mode is a
	 sub-mode of the insert mode. So you can enter this mode when
	 you are in the insert-mode. To leave CTRL-X mode you can 
	 hit any keystroke other than CTRL-X, CTRL-P and CTRL-N. Once
	 you leave CTRL-X mode you return to insert-mode.
      </para>

      <para>
	 CTRL-X mode allows you do auto-completion in a variety of
	 ways. One can even autocomplete filenames. This is
	 particularly useful when you have to include header
	 files. Using CTRL-X mode you can include a file foo.h using
	 the following mechanism.
      </para>

      <programlisting>
	 #include "f CTRL-X CTRL-F"
      </programlisting>

      <para>
	 That's CTRL-X CTRL-F. I know... I know... Its sounds like
	 emacs ;-). There are other things you can do in the CTRL-X
	 mode. One of them is dictionary completion. Dictionary
	 completion allows one to specify a file containing a list of
	 words which are used for completion. By default the
	 dictionary option is not set. This option is set by the
	 command <command>:set dictionary=file</command>. Typically
	 one can put in C keywords, typedefs, #defines in the
	 dictionary file. C++ and Java programmers may be interested
	 in adding class names as well. 
      </para>

      <para>
	 The format of a dictionary file is simple. Just put a word
	 you want in line by itself. So a C dictionary file would look
	 something like this. 
      </para>

      </figure>




      <para>
	 To use the dictionary completion, one needs to hit
	 <keycap>CTRL-X CTRL-K</keycap>. The completion is similar to
	 the <keycap>CTRL-P</keycap> and <keycap>CTRL-N</keycap>
	 keystrokes. So... to type "typedef" all one needs to do is
	 t CTRL-X CTRL-K and poof... the name completed.

	    Restricting column width
	 </title>

	 <para>
	    One often has to restrict the column width to 80 or 75 or
	    whatever. One can set this quite easily by using the
	    command 
	 </para>
	 
	 <screen>
	    <command>:set textwidth=80</command>
	 </screen>

	 <para>
	    To do this automatically just put the command in your .vimrc. 
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    In addition to textwidth you may want the text to wrap at
	    a certain column. Often such choices are dictated by the
	    terminal one is using or it could just be by choice. The
	    command for such a case is 
	 </para>

	 <screen>
	    <command>:set wrapwidth=60</command>
	 </screen>

	 <para>
	    The above command makes the text wrap at 60 columns.
	 </para>

	    Automatically indent code
	 </title>

	 <para>
	    While coding in C, one often indents inner-blocks of
	    code. To do this automatically while coding, VIM has an
	    option called cindent. To set this, just use the command
	 </para>

	 <screen>
	    <command>:set cindent</command>
	 </screen>

	 <para>
	    By setting cindent, code is automatically beautified. To
	    set this command automatically, just add it to your .vimrc 
	 </para>

      </sect2>

      <sect2> 
	 <title>
	    Comments
	 </title>

	 <para>
	    VIM also allows you to auto-format comments. You can split
	    comments into 3 stages: The first part, the middle part
	    and the end part. For example your coding style
	    requirements may require comments to be in the following
	    style 
	 </para>

	 <programlisting>
	    /*
	    * This is the comment
	    */
	 </programlisting>

	 <para>
	    In such a case the following command can be used
	 </para>

	 <screen>
	    <command>:set comments=sl:/*,mb:*,elx:*/</command>
	 </screen>

	 <para>
	    Let me decipher the command for you. The commands has
	    three parts. The first part is sl:/*. This tells VIM that
	    three piece comments begin with /*. The next part tells
	    VIM that the middle part of the comment is *. The last
	    part of the command tells vim a couple of things. One that
	    the command should end with */ and that it should
	    automatically complete the comment when you hit just /. 
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    Let me give another example. Lets say your coding
	    guidelines are as follows 
	 </para>

	 <programlisting>
	    /*
	    ** This is the comment
	    */
	 </programlisting>

	 <para>
	    In such a situation you can use following command for comments
	 </para>

	 <screen>
	    <command>:set comments=sl:/*,mb:**,elx:*</command>
	 </screen>

	 <para>
	    to insert a comment just type /* and hit enter. The next line
	    will automatically contain the **. After you've finished
	    the comment just hit enter again and another ** will be
	    inserted. However to end the comment you want a */ and not 
	    **/. VIM is quite clever here. You don't need to delete
	    the last * and replace it with /. Instead, just hit / and
	    VIM will recognise it as the end of the comment and will
	    automatically change the line from ** to */. 
	 </para>

	 <para>
	    For more info hit
	    <command>
	       :h comments
	    </command>
	 </para>

<!-- Section 6: Editing Multiple files -->

   <sect1 id="multi"> 
      <title>
	 Multi-file editing
      </title> 

      <para> 
	 One often needs to edit more than one file at a time. For
	 example one maybe editing a header file and a source file at
	 the same time. To edit more than one file at a time,
	 invoke VIM using the following command 
      </para>

      <screen>
	 <prompt>$ </prompt><command>vim file1 file2 ...</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
	 Now you can edit the first file and move onto the next file
	 using the command 
      </para>

      <screen>
	 <command>:n</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
	 You can jump back using the command
      </para>

      <screen>
	 <command>:e#</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
	 It may be useful while coding if you could see both the files
	 at the same time and switch between the two. In other words,
	 it would be useful if the screen was split and you could see
	 the header file at the top and the source file at the
	 bottom. VIM has such a command to split the screen. To invoke
	 i, simply say 
	 <command>
	    :split
	 </command>
      </para>

      <para>
	 The same file will be displayed in both the windows. Whatever
	 command is invoked, will affect only the window in focus. So
	 one can edit another file in another window by using the
	 command 
	 <command>
	    :e file2
	 </command>
      </para>

      <para>
	 After executing that command, you'll find that there are two
	 files visible. One window shows the first file and the other shows 
	 the second file. To switch between the files one has to use the
	 keystroke <keycap>CTRL-W CTRL-W</keycap>. To learn more about
	 split windows, just run help on it. 
      </para>

<!-- Section 7: Quickfix -->

   <sect1 id="quickfix"> 
      <title>
	 Quickfix
      </title> 

      <para> 
	 When coding in C one often has a edit-compile-edit
	 cycle. Typically you would edit C file using some the things
	 I've mentioned earlier, save the file, compile the code and
	 go to the error(s) and start editing again. VIM helps save
	 the cycle time slightly using a mode called
	 quickfix. Basically, one has to save the compiler errors in a file
	 and open the file with VIM using the command 
      </para>

      <screen>
	 <prompt>$ </prompt><command>vim -q compiler_error_file</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
	 VIM automatically opens the file containing the error and
	 positions the cursor at the location of the first error.
      </para>

      <para>
	 There is a shortcut to the cycle. Using the command "make", one
	 can automatically compile code and goto the position where
	 the first error occurs. To invoke the make command type the
	 following 
      </para>

      <screen>
	 <command>:make</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
	 Basically, this command calls make in a shell and goes to the
	 first error. However, if you are not compiling using make and
	 are compiling using a command such as cc, then you have to
	 set a variable called makeprg to the command you want invoked
	 when you use the make command. For eg. 
	 <command>
	    :set makeprg=cc\ foo.c
	 </command>
      </para>

      <para>
	 After setting makeprg, you can just call the make command and
	 quickfix will come into play.
      </para>

      <para>
	 After you have corrected the first error, the next thing to
	 do would be go to the next error and correct that. The
	 following command is used go to the next error.
	 <command>
	    :cn
	 </command>
      </para>

      <para>
	 To go back, you can use the command
	 <command>
	    :cN
	 </command>
      </para>

      <para>
	 Let me demonstrate this using an example. Consider the
	 following code
      </para>

      <para>
	 As you can see there is an error on line number 5. The file
	 is saved as test.c and makeprg is set using the command
      </para>

      <screen>
	 <command>:set makeprg=gcc\ test.c</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
	 Next the make command is invoked using the command
	 <command>:make</command>. gcc gives an error and the output
	 of the make command is something like this
      </para>

      <figure>

	    </textobject>

	 </mediaobject>

      </figure>

      <para>
	 On pressing <keycap>RETURN</keycap>, the cursor moves to line
	 number 6.
      </para>

      <para>
	 Now, the command <command>:cn</command> will move the cursor
	 to the line number 4.
      </para>

      <para>
	 To move back to the previous error, one can use the command
	 <command>:cN</command> and the cursor will move back to the
	 line 6.
      </para>

      <para>
	 After correcting the error on line 5 and adding "return 1;",
	 one can run <command>:make</command> again and the output
	 will be
      </para>

      <figure>
	 
	 <title>
	    No Error

      <para>
	 That was just a small example. You can use quickfix to solve
	 your compile time problems and hopefully reduce the
	 edit-compile-edit cycle.
